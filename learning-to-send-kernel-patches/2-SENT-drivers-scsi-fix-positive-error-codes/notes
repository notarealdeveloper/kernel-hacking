# At a few places in the kernel, we see "return ERRCODE;" instead of "return -ERRCODE;"
# Some of these are probably only used as internal signals to other functions in the same module,
# so everything is fine as long as the return code is consistent with the return code check.
# However, some of these are probably returning to higher layers within the kernel (driver core, etc.)
# in which case the errors are *not* being handled properly. Check some of these in more detail eventually,
# and see whether they are actually errors. Also, maybe ask about it on a mailing list, either LKML or 
# perhaps a less scary one.

# In the regex below, I determined that ERROR, etc. were not error codes using:
grep ERROR include/uapi/asm-generic/errno*.h

grep -Pr 'return[ \t]+(?!EOF|END|ERR|ERROR|EEPROMSIZE|ECARDGONE|ECCSFULL|ECCSBUSY|EDUPLICATE)E[A-Z]+;'
grep -Pr 'return[ \t]+[(]?E[A-Z]+[)]?;'

# Also note: The results from net/bluetooth/lib.c are correct,
# because they're in a function that maps bluetooth error codes
# to unix error codes, and that function is called with a negative
# sign, e.g., return -bt_to_errno(rp->status); in drivers/bluetooth/btusb.c

# Final note: The positive return codes in drivers/staging/lustre/lnet/lnet/lib-move.c
# seem to be being used in an okay way. For example, +ENOENT is used to signal
# that an operation succeeded, but no match was found.
