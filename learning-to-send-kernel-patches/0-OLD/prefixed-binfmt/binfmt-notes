Accept all new changes, but then revert the two branches that used
to use !e->mask[0] and !e->magic[0] to the old forms. They worked.
Here's a skeleton commit message:

    fs: binfmt_misc: fix regression with systemd

    Systemd fails to start binfmt.service after the recent
    changes to fs/binfmt_misc.c. This reverts the changes
    that cause those regressions, while keeping everything else.
